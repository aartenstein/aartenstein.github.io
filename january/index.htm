   <p><center>This winter break I was fortunate enough to go to Park City (with my family) and to Acapulco (with my friends).  It was very weird to experience two totally different types of climate but this was for sure the best winter break for my life. I am very grateful that I was able to spend my break surrounded with both friend and family it really was the best of both worlds.</center></p>

Acapulco was a very relaxing yet crazy trip, my best friend from Mexico City invited Becky and I to her apartment in Acapulco. Her apartment is very cool because its only for Jewish people (this is very common there), so that meant that we would hang out with all her friends from school all day. We would walk on the beach, hang out on the pool, play board games, ride ATV’s along the beach, and in he night go out with everyone. I went to a club were my grandparents went on there honeymoon and my dad would go when he was my age. https://www.babyo.com.mx.  I would find my friends from San Diego like Jack, Mark, Gianni, Alexis, and Joseph who were there as well.</p>

  <p style="color:blue">Park City was one of the best trips I’ve had with my family. It was my first time seeing snow fall (crazy right?), literally one the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen in my life. I was surprisingly very good at skiing and found it so therapeutic and adventurous even though my legs were int he worst pain. We went with my family friends but didn’t see them during the day cause they would go down black mountains.  In the night we would catch up with them for dinner or a nice jacuzzi.</p>
