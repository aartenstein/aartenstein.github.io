        <h2>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h2>
        
      <p>This is a really simple dish to prepare and its always a big hit at parties. My father recommends:</p>
           <blockquote>"Made this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just bring it up to room temprature before you serve it. In the winter,try serving it warm"</blockquote>
